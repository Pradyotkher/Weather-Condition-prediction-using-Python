# Weather-Condition-prediction-using-Python
We combine IoT and python to predict the Codntions of the day by using the parameters such as Smoke sky , Clear Sky , Haze Sky. The components used are an ESP8266, DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor.
The paarameters we will be considering for this are Dew Point, Humidity , Pressure and Temperature
The Temperature and Humidity is measured by the DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor and posted to ThingSpeak . From there we have retrieved thee values and combined the dataset with dewpoint and pressure values.
